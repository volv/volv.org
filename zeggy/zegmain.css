<div class='news1'><h2>17/11/2015 21:31:27<h1>Top Tip:</h1></h2><br/>Drivers, for that authentic rally car straight cut gear whine, drive everywhere in reverse.
</div>
<div class='news2'><h2>08/11/2015 00:42:00<h1>Ad blocking</h1></h2><br/>Holy shit, I disabled adblock, how do you people even internet?
</div>
<div class='news1'><h2>03/11/2015 11:10:24<h1>Wasn't me</h1></h2><br/>DB server was down, no idea how long for but that's cheap hosting for you.

<div class='news2'><h2>27/10/2015 09:48:31<h1>Steam</h1></h2><br/>Remember when Steam was shit, when we all just wanted to play HL2 but were forced to install that POS? Here's the thing, it didnt get better, still takes longer to load than Windows, randomly decides it can't connect and generally sits there like the putrefying bloated corpse it is. The built in web browser is slower than IE6.
</div>
<div class='news1'><h2>24/10/2015 15:55:07<h1>Zoom - Zoom</h1></h2><br/>Most of the scaling issues should be fixed, well at least in chrome&FF anyways with the added bonus of not looking like a pile of shit on mobile.

						&copy;az23 2015, Opinions expressed here are just that:

						These are just words, and no offense is intended, but these days people get arrested for telling jokes
						on twitter because feelings are more important than fundamental human rights.  So please remember: you are
